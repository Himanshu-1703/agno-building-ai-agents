# **📂 Repository Structure**

This project is organized into modular folders, each focusing on a major part of building agentic systems:

* **agno-basics/** – Core Agno components and foundational concepts
* **agno-knowledge/** – Knowledge management, RAG, and retrieval systems
* **agno-teams/** – Multi-agent architecture and team orchestration
* **agno-workflows/** – Workflow patterns: sequential, parallel, conditional, branching, looping
* **medium-article-generator/** – Project 1: Agentic Medium article generator
* **agno-data-science-team/** – Project 2: Multi-agent data science system

# **📚 Curriculum**

## **Module 1 — GenAI vs Agentic AI & Agno’s Role 🤖⚙️**

* GenAI focuses on generating content while Agentic AI performs actions using goals, reasoning, memory, and tools.
* Agno provides a structured framework to build these agentic systems end-to-end.

## **Module 2 — Introduction to Agno & Its Components 🧩**

1. **Install Agno on system 💻** – Learn how to set up Agno and prepare the environment.
2. **Build your first agent 🛠️** – Create a simple agent capable of responding to user inputs.
3. **Add memory to your agent 🧠** – Integrate memory so the agent can recall previous interactions or information.
4. **Add tool functionality to your agent 🔧** – Equip the agent with tools to perform actions beyond text generation.
5. **Sessions and session state 📂** – Understand temporary storage that lets agents maintain context during interactions.

## **Module 3 — Implementing Agentic RAG in Agno 📚🔍**

1. **Implement traditional RAG using knowledge 📖** – Build a retrieval pipeline where the agent pulls information from stored knowledge.
2. **Implement Agentic RAG using knowledge search tools 🛠️🔎** – Use agent-driven search tools that allow autonomous multi-step information retrieval.

---

## **Module 4 — Teams in Agno (Multi-Agent Systems) 👥🤝**

1. **How team of agents work in Agno 🧭** – Learn how orchestrators coordinate different agents to collaborate.
2. **Implementing states in teams 🔄** – Explore how shared or team-level state maintains continuity between agents.

---

## **Module 5 — Building Workflows 🔗⚡**

a. **Sequential ➡️** – Tasks execute in a fixed order.
b. **Parallel 🔀** – Multiple tasks or agents run simultaneously.
c. **Conditional ❓➡️** – Flow branches based on conditions or agent outputs.
d. **Looping 🔁** – Steps repeat until a specific criterion is met.
e. **Branching 🌿** – Workflow splits into multiple paths and merges later as needed.

---

## **Module 6 — Project 1: Medium Article Generator ✍️📰**

Build an agentic system that researches a topic, retrieves knowledge through different areas of research, drafts an article, and improves it through iterative reasoning and memory.

---

## **Module 7 — Project 2: Data Science Team 📊🤖**

Design a multi-agent setup where specialized agents (Data Ingestion, EDA, modeling, evaluation) collaborate under an orchestrator to complete an end-to-end data science task.
